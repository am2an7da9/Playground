  <title>Swings with Friends and Squirrels</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In this chapter we will talk about <q>swings</q> and <q>swing sets.</q>
      Keep in mind that by <em>swings </em> we mean something that has some structure with rope-like 
    items which allows the person or <term> object </term> to move in the air. Often this is <alert>parabolic</alert>
     and is of the form <m>f(x,y)=ay^2 </m> or 
  <me>f(x,y)=x^2 </me>. </p>
